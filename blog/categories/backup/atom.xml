    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Git is a great tool – not only for version control. Ever wondered what would
happen to your local Git repositories you use to store private projects,
documents or other arbitrary data after your hard drive crashes?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Most
probably – if you don’t use any other means of backup – it will be lost:
Surprise! No, not really, Git is based on plain files and there’s no way to
recover from file corruption.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Therefore you should not forget to backup
your Git repositories, too.</p>

<p>If you use a Git host like <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> or <a href="http://gitorious.org">Gitorious</a> it’s pretty easy to
have at least one additional repository to increase your data security. Once
you added your online repository as a remote and pushed to it, you have a
full<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> copy of your repository contents at another location, elminitating
your local hard drive as a single point of failure. But what about private
repositories you don’t want (or you are not allowed to) host on a third-party
server?</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>The most obvious solution is an own Git host, but this isn’t a simple task. You
need the hardware (at least virtual on another physical host) and more
importantly you need the knowledge to setup and maintain a Git server. To get
the latter you may want to read <a href="http://progit.org/book/ch4-0.html">chapter 4</a> of Scott Chacon’s excellent book
<a href="http://progit.org">Pro Git</a>. But nevertheless it’s time-consuming and most probably overkill
to just have a secure backup copy of your repositories.</p>

<p>A much simpler method is adequate for some ordinary backup scenarios – e.g.
backing up to a local NAS (like a USB drive) or another network share (for
example your private network drive on your company’s file server). These cases
have in common that although data is stored on a remote hard drive, there’s no
need to use a sophisticated network transport protocol – like Git’s own
protocol or HTTP(S). Everything is transferred on top of the file system, that
may be something like NFS, CIFS or AFP. So the heavy lifting is done by your
operating system (or better, its file system implementation) and Git does not
need to do anything special as the local file protocol is used. Therefore Git
does not need to know anything about your infrastructure, hardware or whatever.
So you don’t need to configure anything – aside from your remote(s). That’s
why setting up Git backups is simple and even works when the underlying
infrastructure changes.</p>

<p>If you use Git for more than local storage you should be pretty comfortable
with remotes. Although Git provides several options for remotes, like the refs
that should be pushed and pulled. Configuring a remote for backup usage is even
simpler: A backup repository is configured as a mirror remote:</p>

<p><code>
git remote add --mirror backup /Volumes/Storage
</code></p>

<p>That way, you don’t need to worry about what is pushed to this remote
repository. Every branch and every tag is always pushed, even if the changes
are non-forward. So you never have to worry if you forgot anything. The
following will always result in a fully up-to-date remote repository:</p>

<p><code>
git push backup
</code></p>

<p>Instead of the more lengthy alternative (<code>git push -f backup refs/*</code>).</p>

<p>You see, backups using Git are pretty easy, but it’s getting even better.
Instead of relying on a command to initiate an update of your backup(s), you
most probably want to do this automatically. A good way to do this periodically
is Unix’ cron or Windows’ scheduled tasks. Just configure the command above to
be run inside your repositories at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Another, more sophisticated way for automatic backups is using Git’s own hooks.
Using e.g. the <code>post-commit</code> hook, you might update your backups every time you
commit to your repository. That might seem to be a bit too much and depending
on your repository contents and network speed pushing into your backup
repository may really take some time. So you might want to tweak your hook, so
that not every commit is pushed, but only some of them. You might check the
timestamp or the contents of the commit or several other things – Git’s hooks
can be a really mighty tool.</p>

<p>Have a look at the following hooks to see some examples of automatically
triggering a new backup:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/607502.js?file='></script>

#
# This is a demonstration hook that can be used to automatically update a
# backup repository.
#
# Save this file as post-commit to the .git/hooks directory of a Git
# repository and make it executable (`chmod u+x`). This will enable
# automatic backups to a remote repository if the last commit is a specific
# amount of time older than the current one. 

# The timeout is the amount of seconds that the last commit has to be older
# than the current one to trigger a new backup
timeout=3600
# The name of the remote repository to backup to. This should be a mirror
# repository, i.e. remote.&lt;remote&gt;.mirror has to be true.
remote=backup

current_timeout=`git log -1 --pretty=format:%ct HEAD`
last_timeout=`git log -1 --pretty=format:%ct HEAD^`
diff=$[$current_timeout - $last_timeout]

if [ $diff -gt $timeout ]
  then git push $remote
fi</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Like said before, the hooks above are only samples of what can be done. They
may be not that useful for your specific use case and infrastructure. But
backing up using Git is practicable and does not need any special hardware or
software (except Git of course). Additionally that way of backing up is even
useful in pretty restricted enterprise architectures. On the other hand it may
also fit the most complex infrastructures – I’m thinking of multiple Git
repositories here, where one acts as some sort of proxy, automatically
triggering backups to multiple other repository e.g. using a <code>post-receive</code>
hook. You see… boundless possibilities.</p>

<p>So you may find better ways to implement your own Git-based backup system –
feel free to share them.</p>
